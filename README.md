# SenseWAI.us
SenseWAI aims to warn blind pedestrians for incoming objects using the AI powered computer vision capabilities of their phone cameras. Using a custom trained YOLOv11 model, a powerful neural network implemented by Ultralytics, detecting crosswalks and relaying information to the blind user can occur within moments. Additionally Google Gemini gives the user a overview of their visible surroundings including warnings for up-close obstacles and changes in elevation in the floor.
